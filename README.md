# Tiny_CD_CS5824

This was to test TinyCD on other datasets. Credit to the original owners: https://github.com/AndreaCodegoni/Tiny_model_4_CD

In order to test training results you will need to download the LEVIR-CD database here: 

LEVIR-CD: https://justchenhao.github.io/LEVIR/

and place it in the cloned folder.

The bash script TinyCD.sh should create the necessary environment, show the training results and show the error when tested with the other datasets.
